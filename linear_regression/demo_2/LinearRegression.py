Description:
- You are working for a restaurant franchise. The franchise wants to open new restaurants in various cities.

Goal:
- Predict the profit of a restaurant based on the population of the city where it is located.
- The data is provided in the file RegressionData.csv.
- The chain already has several restaurants in different cities.
- Model the relationship between profit and population using linear regression.

Steps: 
- Load the data from RegressionData.csv.
- Visualize the data using a scatter plot.
- Train a linear regression model using the training data.
- Use the trained model to predict the profit of a restaurant in a city with a population of 18.

# Open the csv file RegressionData.csv in Excel, notepad++ or any other applications to have a 
# rough overview of the data at hand. 
# You will notice that there are several instances (rows), of 2 features (columns). 
# The values to be predicted are reported in the 2nd column.

# Load the data from the file RegressionData.csv in a pandas dataframe. Make sure all the instances 
# are imported properly. Name the first feature 'X' and the second feature 'y' (these are the labels)

# Plot the data using a scatter plot to visualize the data
plt.scatter(X, y) 

# Linear regression using least squares optimization

reg.fit(X, y) 

# Plot the linear fit
